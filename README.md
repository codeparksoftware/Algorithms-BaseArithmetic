# Algorithms-BaseArithmetic
X Based Converter class
This source code is free to copy and use.It was developed by c# . It contains string to decimal and decimal to string converter functions on X Based. Also if you need to use custom character set you may use and create your custom set.(a-Z,0-9 etc.) Length was defined to specify length of digits. I paid attention to the algorithm's quick operationâ€¦
